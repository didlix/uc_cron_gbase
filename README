This module borrows from the uc_gbase module which borrowed from the googlebase module.
The latter does not work so well with Ubercart and the former had many bugs and no cron implementation.
So I have decided to create a seperate module that will hopefully be cleaner, less buggy and more featureful.
I have added a bunch of settings (so you can control if products are submitted automatically, default taxonomy, default conditions).
I have removed payment options since they don't seem to be a part of google base' search in any way.
Currency will load from ubercart, not be hardcoded to US and tax will be calculated.


Development of this is being funded by my friends at www.afterhours.co.uk - they sell gaming stuff, games are cool
Development is being performed by Net Dojo LLP.
